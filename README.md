# Overview

This repository contains the PCB design files and accompanying firmware for the Data Collection Board of the S&T Rocket Design Team's SRAD Avionics system.

## Purpose and Motivation
The goal of this project is to create flight-rate PCBs that can collect information about the teams rockets as they are launched.

## Inspirations

Initial developments of this board are to be more or less a direct replacement for a Telemetrum V3, with features and design optimizations to be implemented in future revisions.

A [Telemetrum V3](https://altusmetrum.org/TeleMetrum/) is an amateur rocketry telemetry solution from [Altus Metrum](https://altusmetrum.org/index.html).

[Signal](https://bps.space/signal/) from [BPS.Space](https://bps.space/) is a flight computer first and a data collection solution second. It is designed to stream data to the ground station, although it is likely insufficient for the large 10-30k ft class rockets that our team constructs.

There is also a really cool KiCad tutorial around making a small thumb drive sized pcb with an STM32, RF, and USB components. The link is [here on youtube by Phil's Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14_jh3nLSsU) and is a great tutorial on using circuit design software and the process/approach you go through making something like this. Highly recommended to watch and maybe take some notes on, and a pretty solid start for our telemetry board.
